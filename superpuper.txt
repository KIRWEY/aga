(Don’t type the $; that just indicates that you’re doing this at the command line.)

I also do:

$ git config --global color.ui true
$ git config --global core.editor emacs
The first of these will enable colored output in the terminal; the second tells git that you want to use emacs.

Set up ssh on your computer. I like Roger Peng’s guide to setting up password-less logins. Also see github’s guide to generating SSH keys.

Look to see if you have files ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
If not, create such public/private keys: Open a terminal/shell and type:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
Copy your public key (the contents of the newly-created id_rsa.pub file) into your clipboard. On a Mac, in the terminal/shell, type:

$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
